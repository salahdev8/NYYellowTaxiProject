Abstract


Big data is not a new concept. However, with the immense evolution in the metropolitan areas and technology almost  90 percent of the available data was created in the last few years. The importance of big data  doesnâ€™t reside on how much data we collected but how we utilize the collected data in a way that will help analyze, solve problems and create new growth opportunities. This Project highlights the  prevailing use of urban big data in   analyzing the yellow  taxicab daily earning average per hour  using the most updated dataset given by TLC of NYC, by applying MapReduce model, spark, Hive and BigQuery to come up with the best result. Based on our result we are planning to find solution on how to bring up the yellow taxi earning average to its highest level.  With this solution we will help Yellow taxi  companies services as well as drivers, and more important we will preserve  one of the NYC symbolic elements from been invaded.



Problem:

NYC Yellow Taxicab business has been decreasing lately, and many taxi drivers has  switched to other companies. Some of the factors are:
   *Yellow Taxicab earning average is decreasing 
   *Competition of Companies like UBER
   *Lack of real time  analysis to yellow taxi trips
   *The wrong choice and estimation of the best time and location
